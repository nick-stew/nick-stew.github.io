1. Hi.  This is my first project.  Let me start out with my instructer Nancy is awsome!!  But this week was very hard on me.  I am not making excuses but to start with my Open IDE was not working even the downloaded version.  So I had set up a local enviroment that gave me trouble up until we finally got it installed on Tuesday.  I was finally able to get started on my project.  I was trying to make it real simple and I think I made it harder than it should have been.  First, let me tell you that my cpu fundamentals are not the best.  I did not grow up with a computer, did not ever have to use one in HS.  I really just started about 10 years ago.  So, I am already behind most of my classmates.  Lets get back to the project.  My first idea was to have my project find cheap gas.  Not thinking, most of the gas station web sites does not have the price per gallon on their website because the price changes from store to store.  So I changed it to gas station finder.  After running the test we could not get the project to work because of the websites I scraped did not have good code.  So I had to scrap that.  I ended up doing my project on breweries.  The app you should be able to pull up breweries in your state and pick one out of the list to get more info about.
