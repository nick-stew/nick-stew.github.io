 My name is Nick Stewart.  I am a southern boy who grew up in Alabama and moved to North Georgia in my mid 20’s.  I met my better half in GA and married her 2 years later.  She is the smart and pretty one out of the both of us.  We have a 19 year old and a 5 year old.  I went to school to be an industrial maintenance tech.  After I got my 2 year degree I started working for a propane company as a service tech.  I loved that job but during a mild winter I was laid off because nobody was buying gas.  I decided to go into a new career that does not lay off because of a mild winter, so I got my insurance license.  I have been selling insurance for the past 7 years.  I liked it but I did not love it.  I did not like working off of commission.  I have a few friends that programmed.  I asked them questions about it and they told me that it is not easy but it is not rocket science either.  I have always wondered how everything on a website works.  How do you build a website?  So to answer the question “ why did I want to become a software engineer?”  1.  I wanted a career that has plenty of job opportunities and pays good.  2.  I was tired of the insurance business.  3.  Wanted a job that you go and do your job and that is it.  Not worrying about if you are going to sell a policy.  4.  I am not getting any younger, my body can’t take physical labor like I use to do in my 20’s.  5.  I am just interested in how things work.  And to conclude this blog it was time for me to make a change and start preparing for my 2nd half of life.
